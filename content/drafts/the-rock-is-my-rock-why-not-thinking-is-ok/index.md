I was recently ‘Netflix shamed’ by a colleague. During a presentation they mentioned that they liked to spend the little free time they have, as optimally as they could. Rather than wasting time on Netflix they would prefer to watch something educational, or learn a new skill. 

I felt mildly attacked. One of my favorite past times is watching trashy shows on Netflix. I was probably the data anomaly that made them create the ‘are you REALLY still watching this crap?’ feature. 

## Side Hustle Shame.

Although my colleague had no ill intent you see this pattern a lot on social media. Life hacking, entrepreneur, successful side hustle types telling you that you that they spend all of their available time bettering them selves, and you should as well. 

Stories about Elon Musk reading a book a day when he was starting out his career and how all super successful people wake up at 4am for 4 hours of self betterment and work before the rest of the lazy slobs get to work. 

But I worry this side hustle shame is an unattainable goal for most, putting pressure on the the rest of us to push our selves to hard and towards out own burn out. 

## Selling Sunset

So instead of waking up at an on godly hours, to read books, perform an hours of the lastest meditational yoga trend and guilt email all your colleagues about how much work you did over the weekend i prescribe an alternative. 

Trash TV and ‘terrible’ movies. 

My current favorite is Selling Sunset, a program about a bunch of well dressed drama fulled sycophants, and two handsome mini twins who sell multi million dollar mansions in the Hollywood Hills, it’s AMAZING. 

I’m also a major fan of movies it’s Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson in them. 

And watching this stuff I think it my key to success.

## Brain Rest

My avid passion for both trashy TV and The Rock can sometimes come as a bit of a surprise to people when they first find out. I’m a reasonably intelligent and cultured middle aged guy, probably not the person that the commissioning board had in mind when these shows and movie where pitched.

But actually, I find them a kind of therapy. 

## Fun Therapy. 

Before I continue, I would like to clarify that I’m not trying to pretend that I watch this stuff ‘ironically’. I genuinely love watching this stuff, I find enjoyable. These things are not ‘guilty pleasures’ they just pleasures.

But the major benefits I find in this type of viewing is the mindlessness of it all. The ability to switch off and not think about things for a few hours. 

I do all my thinking in front of a computer screen, I don’t want to invest any more brain cycles trying to work out what David Lynch and Charlie Kaufman are trying to tell me about the world, or what the actual fuck is going on in Dark.  

## Rest your most valuable asset. 

You hear a lot that ‘the brain is just like a muscle’. I’ve been reading some psychology books recently and it really is not. However what the brain and muscles do have in common is that they need rest. 

For me, the perfect rest for my brain is an easy to enjoy action movie with a lot of things exploding and a couple of over the top, hammy, but charming actors duking it out to save the world. 

An evening in front of Netflix recharges my brain allowing me to come in to work the next day with all my neurons firing. 

## Lazy Shaming

So don’t feel guilty about that ‘mindless’ pass time that you like to participate in, it’s not ‘rotting’ your brain. It’s recharging it. 

Fire up your Candy Crush Sage, plug in your PlayStation, read that trashy gossip website that you love, mindlessly skip through those Tik Tok videos of cute puppies falling of things. 

Then wake up the next day with your brain on full charge, ready to kick ass.
