Being bread British has imprinted a humble self-deprecating thread through my consciousness. But I’ve got to the point in my life where I can confidently say I’m an above average leader. I might even go as far as saying I’m a **good** leader. 

Getting to this point of confidence however has taken me a long long time, it was a long journey of team years of leading teams that has lead me to this point, only in the last two years have I started to understand what makes me a good leader. 

## Weak, Shy, and Quiet.

I sometimes hide it well now, but at my core I’m continually terrified over analyzing introvert. There are social interactions from 15 years ago that still haunt me to this day, I play them back over and over. 

Like the time I said good bye to a really good, recently out, old friend using an increasingly inappropriate homophobic slur. I meant it as playful joke, his face said otherwise. We have barely spoken since. 

Any point in my life where I’ve caused anyone any kind of emotional discomfort still haunts me. 

For a long time this has also shown as a pattern in my work appraisals. I have always been given feedback that I could have been more forceful with my team to get them to deliver harder, faster, better, more productive. 

## Carrots or Stick

We all know the Carrot or Stick metaphors, you either coax a horse in the direction you want with a carrot or you hit it with a stick. 

I always used a carrots with my teams, and my managers always wanted me to hit them harder with a stick. 

But I could never do it, all I could think of was their sad faces when they received any kind of punishment. 

## But, results. 

However, over time I started to see a pattern, when ever I was in a situation where I was leading a team with me weak, carrot based, leadership style my teams would invariably produce better results over longer periods. 

Sure I struggled to convince teams to put in extra work when someone else set an unachievable deadline that I didn’t believe it

## Empathetic, Smart, and Personable.
